# discord-book-bot
A linux bot that sends messages using your main account.

Made for Linux on a screen resolution of 1440x900.

Usage: main.py arg1
    Where arg1 is the file with all the messages you want to send.

Instructions:
    - Maximize Discord on your left monitor
    - Chante to wherever chat room you want to send your messages
    - Run the program (preferencially on another monitor.)
    - Just wait for it.

Depending on your internet connection, you will want to change the 57th line
to a slower or faster number.

Project will probably be discontinued because I'm not really interested in improving it.
If you want to copy my code or to change it in any way that you want, feel free to do so.


Bye!
